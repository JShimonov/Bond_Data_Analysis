# How Did COVID-19 Impact Corporate Bonds and Treasury Securities

## About
This repsitory is meant to highlight the work that was done for my Economics Honors Seminar where I have to write my Economics thesis paper about any Economics related topic that I want. As the name of the repository suggests, the focus of the research paper is on bond data, but more specifically on how COVID-19 impacted corporate bonds and treasury securites. The data collected for this research involves time series data collected from Bloomberg Terminal as well as data from the Federal Reserve. (As of right now, the data has not been finalized, there may be more data that will be used in the future)
